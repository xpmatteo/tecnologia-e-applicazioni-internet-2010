== Add a real database ==

Continuing from last time, we now have a Jdbc implementation of CourseBase in
place. There is one thing that is still not working, though: the editing of
existing courses.

Note that the database url and credentials are *not* hardwired; they are passed to the application through the classpath.  The configuration file is config/courses.properties.  I added an option to the java command in  script/server.sh so that the config directory becomes part of the classpath.  

Should you wish to deploy the application in some other servlet container, you would need to add the courses.properties file in its classpath somehow.  

An alternative way to pass this information is to make a DataSource available with JNDI.  Perhaps we'll use this method in a later lesson.


== How to proceed ==

a) Make sure that CourseBase.findAll does retrieve the ID of the courses
b) Implement CourseBase.findById
c) Implement CourseBase.update


== How to run ==

First thing, create the databases with

 $ script/create_databases.sh

This needs only be done once. Open a terminal window on the project directory.
Execute the following command:

 $ script/server.sh

If you're on Windows, you would type

 > script\server.bat

Then open a browser at http://localhost:8080/

The Windows script may fail for a number of reasons. You may have to customize
it for your installation.
