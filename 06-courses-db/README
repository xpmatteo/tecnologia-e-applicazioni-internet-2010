== About ==

This is a rewrite of the exercise of last class.  We do less TDD and more open exploration of how to get the most expressive and clean code we can.


What works: 
 - You can List and Create courses
 - You can edit the course, but saving changes won't work.
 
== Exercise ==

a) Fix the error in editing courses

b) Add a "delete" link to the courses listing

c) Add a common layout.  The layout should be defined in a single place and applied to all pages.  The layout should use the /stylesheets/style.css file that is found in src/main/webapp

d) (Advanced.)  A course is offered in many editions.  
   * Add a CRUD for creating and editing the editions of a course.  An edition has a time and a place.
   * Add an /app/calendar page that shows all future editions of courses.



 
== Points to ponder ==

 + Can you see duplication in the code?  Can you think of a way to eliminate it?

 + How do you feel with respect to the Course object, which is a sad object with only getters and setters and no behaviour?  Can you imagine a way to assign to it some responsibilities and behaviour?


== How to run ==

Execute

 $ script/server.sh

then open browser at http://localhost:8080
