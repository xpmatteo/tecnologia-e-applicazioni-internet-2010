This is a collection of small katas for my Internet Technology and Application
course [0]. Katas are grouped by lesson. Some were performed by me in class,
others contain just starting points for the student's lab work.

The objective is to develop a nice sense of TDD and object design. I try to
focus on objects and simplicity. Therefore I will try to use as little
third-party technology as possible. No HtmlUnit, or HttpUnit, or (gasp!)
Selenium. (By the way, I like both HtmlUnit and HttpUnit, but I'm exploring
how far you can go without using them. I dislike Selenium.)

I will write READMEs in English.
