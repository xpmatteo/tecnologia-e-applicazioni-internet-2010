== About ==

At the beginning of this course I was talking about how to make our code easy to change, and we said that having many IF's is an indication of poor code quality. 

Now if we look at the code of the Courses application from last lesson, in particular CoursesApp, we see that the service() method contains a lot of IF's!  It's true that the code is not too unreadable, but we are falling short of the ideals we set forth in the first lessons.

In this lesson we work to make our code closer to our ideals.  We stop work on the courses application for a while, and we try a new exercise.

This exercise is about a geometry application; we want to be able to compute geometric formulae such as the area of a square, or the volume of a sphere.  And we want to make it modular: adding a new page for a new formula should be a matter of changing only TWO things:

 - create a new class for the page 
 - change the construction code in GeometryServlet, method service().

 
 
== Exercise ==

Read the code in GeometryApp, method service().  See how much simpler it is?  We shifted a lot of complexity in the list of page components, which is built in the GeometryServlet application.  

=== Fix the crash ===

Run the application.  It will crash.  Your first task is to fix it.  When you are done, you should be able to see 

a) the welcome page at url http://localhost:8080/
b) the square area page at url http://localhost:8080/geo/square-area
c) the triangle area page at url http://localhost:8080/geo/triangle-area
d) the sphere volume page at url http://localhost:8080/geo/sphere-volume

=== Fix navigation ===

You will notice that our page says "Navigation should be here".  Fix it by providing a list of links to all the pages that are available.  You may have to add a new method to the PageComponent interface, to make it return the preferred url at which the page will respond.

=== Complete the other pages ===

"Area of a triangle" and "Volume of a sphere" are not completed.  Implement them.

=== Have fun! ===

Change the list of pages.  Add something of your invention.  See how easy it is to change the structure of this web application?
