== End to end tests ==

End-to-end tests are a means to describe a whole scenario, told in terms of what the user does with the system and sees the system do. 

One important thing to keep in mind is that these tests are slow and brittle.  For this reason it's important to make them as expressive and readable as possible.

There are different opinions in the Agile community about the value of e2e tests.  Freeman and Pryce are strong proponents, and have written a book [0] that shows how to use e2e tests well.  James Shore, author of The Art Of Agile Development, argues against them.  Who's right?  That's not for me to say.  Try them, see if they work for you, reflect about your work and make your opinion.

There are different technical means to implement these tests.  My favourite Java tool for web apps is HtmlUnit.


== How to proceed ==

I created a new source directory for e2e tests.  Running these tests probably does not work on Windows.  You'll have to comment out the @BeforeClass section and run the application manually.  Or better, start using Linux or other Unix derivatives for running these exercises.

There is a failing e2e test.  Your job is to make it work.  Once it works, you may want to write a new e2e test to cover the "edit an existing Course" scenario.

== How to run ==

Open a terminal window on the project directory.  Create the databases with

 $ script/create_databases.sh

This needs only be done once. There is a test user in the database, with login
and password "admin", "secret".

Execute the following command:

 $ script/server.sh

If you're on Windows, you would type

 > script\server.bat

instead. Then open a browser at http://localhost:8080/
