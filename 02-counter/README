== Exercise performed by me in class ==

This is a simple kata inspired by the Counter example from the Seaside documentation [0].  This very small application shows a counter that you can increment or decrement.

The point of all this is to show how to unit-test servlet-based code.  The pattern is similar to the Humble Object pattern by Michael Feathers [1], the Ports and Adapters architecture by Alistair Cockburn [2], and expecially the post "Interfacing with hard-to-test third-party code" by Mi≈°co Hevery [3].
