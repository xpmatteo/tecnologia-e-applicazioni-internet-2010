== About ==

This is an exercise we did in class. It is a starting point for an application
to manage public training courses, with publication of course calendars,
enrolling into courses from the web, and so on.

For a start, we do a simple CRUD for courses. In this first version, we don't
have a real database; we can demonstrate the application working with a fake
in-memory database. The data are not persistent, but it's enough to
demonstrate the functionality to our customers.

The first user story is inserting a new course.  The full acceptance test would work like this:

 0. Open the application at http://localhost:8080/
 1. The application shows 0 courses
 2. Click on "New Course"; the app shows a form.
 3. Enter the title and description of the course, and click "OK"
 4. The application redirects to the course listing page
 5. There is now a course with the given title and description.

What works: 
 - Courses have a title (but not the description)
 - the listing page works
 - you can simulate step 3 with an offline form, provided here in file form.html
 - steps 4 and 5 work
 
== Exercise ==

a) Complete the first scenario.

b) Add an "edit" link to every row in the listing, that allows the user to change the course details.

 
== Points to ponder ==

 + How much of the html pages can you develop with tests, and how much you should develop by visual feedback?
 + How to deal with the contextPath and servletPath?  Do you handle them in the servlet or in the Application object?

== How to run ==

Execute

 $ script/server.sh

then open browser at http://localhost:8080
