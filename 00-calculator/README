== Exercise performed by me in class ==

This is my introductory TDD example.  A demo of the finished application :-) is:

  $ cd bin
  $ java Main "3 + 4"
  7
  $

It's very small, but it shows that it pays to distribute responsibilities: the
Parser class parses the input, the Calculator class performs the calculation.

The payoff of using two objects, as opposed to rolling all functionality into
one, is that the add(int, int) method would then be a private method of the
Calculator, making it difficult to test. By splitting responsibilities in two
objects, the add(int, int) becomes a public method of a collaborator.
