== Exercise: write a hex-to-decimal converter  ==

The application should show a text field, where the user can enter a number.

There should also be two buttons, one labelled "To Dec" and the other labelled
"To Hex". Only one of the two buttons should be enabled at all times.

Scenario: 
 
 - The user opens the application.  The text field shows "0".  "To Hex" is enabled.  "To Dec" is not enabled.

 - The user enters 16 and clicks "To Hex"

 - The application shows "10" in the text field. "To Dec" is enabled, "To
   Hex" is disabled.

 - the user enters FF in the text field and clicks "To Dec".
 
 - The application shows 255 in the text field.  "To Hex" is enabled.

A button may be "disabled" by rendering its label as simple text, instead of a
button.


== Note ==

This exercise should be done in TDD, with a component-based design similar to
the one in the ../02-counter application.



== How to run ==

Execute

 $ script/server.sh

then open browser at http://localhost:8080/
