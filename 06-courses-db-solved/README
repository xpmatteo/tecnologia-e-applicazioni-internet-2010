== Add a real database ==

We want to substitute the FakeCourseBase with a real database implementation.
We have two new scripts:

 - script/dbconsole.sh opens a hsqldb console; 
 - script/create_databases.sh creates a test and development databases, 
   with Hsqldb.

These two scripts use the config/sqltool.rc configuration file. That file
defines two databases, one for test and one for development.

The goal of this exercise is to substitute the "new FakeCourseBase()" in
CoursesServlet with a "new JdbcCourseBase()". The latter should use Hsqldb to
access a real database.

== How to proceed ==

Make sure that you can see the application working in the browser (see "How to
run" below). Don't proceed unless you can!!

Make sure that this project in Eclipse runs all the tests.  

Make sure that what you have in Eclipse is exactly the same code you are
running from the command line :-) This is a fairly common problem with
students.

The first step is to change the "new FakeCourseBase()" in CoursesServlet with
"new JdbcCourseBase()". Check that the application now is broken. If it isn't,
it means you are not passing the check described in the previous paragraph.

Now start implementing the JdbcCourseBase methods using Jdbc.  The first method I would suggest to work on is "count()".  


== Points to ponder ==

How to write unit tests for JdbcCourseBase?  

How to make sure that the tests use a different database from the one used in development?  

How do we pass the database configuration information to the application? Is
it OK to wire the url, username and password directly in Java code?

How do you feel about Jdbc code? Is it clear? Is it verbose? Would it be a
good idea to keep Jdbc code in a separate object?


== How to run ==

Open a terminal window on the project directory. Execute the following
command:

 $ script/server.sh

If you're on Windows, you would type

 > script\server.bat

Then open a browser at http://localhost:8080/

The Windows script may fail for a number of reasons. You may have to customize
it for your installation.
